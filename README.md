#CSCI 303 Algorithms
Catalog Description: A systematic study of algorithms and their complexity, including searching, sorting, selecting, and algorithms for graphs. A survey of algorithm design methods, including greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and backtracking. An introduction to NP-complete problems. 

#C++ Projects
Iterative and Recursive Mergesort: Function templates was used in the implementation of both iterative and recursive mergesort.

Quicksort: Function templates along with namespaces were used in the implemenation of quicksort. 

Kruskal's Algortihm: The use of C++ classes and priority queue were used in the implemenation of this algorithm for a minimum weight spanning trees (MST). Files: union_find.cpp, edge.cpp, mst.cpp, and graph.cpp
